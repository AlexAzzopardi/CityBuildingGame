<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Hello,

I am excited to share a city-building game project that I undertook during my A-levels (2017). The challenge was to create a game from scratch, drawing inspiration from renowned titles like Banished and Cities Skylines. This endeavor represents a significant milestone in my coding journey, marking my first-ever large-scale project.

Admittedly, the code presented in this repository reflects my early programming efforts, and it's important to note that substantial improvements have been made since then. Over the course of this project, I was learning to code on the fly, resulting in an evolving understanding of basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

While the coding may appear amateurish in this context, I want to assure you that my skills have progressed considerably since this period. Subsequent projects showcase a more refined and sophisticated approach to coding and game development.

I invite you to explore this creation with the understanding that it captures a pivotal learning phase. I am eager to discuss the project further and provide insights into the advancements I have made in my coding proficiency.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my early work. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to share my growth and development in the realm of game development.!</p>
