# City Building Game Project

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game:**
   - Navigate to the "CityBuildingGamePlayable" folder.
   - Execute "Build1.1.exe" in 1920x1080 resolution.
   - Click play in the main menu, and allow about 30 seconds for the game to load due to the older version of Unity.

## Project Overview

Hello,

I am thrilled to share a city-building game project that I developed during my A-levels in 2017. The challenge was to create a game from scratch, drawing inspiration from renowned titles such as Banished and Cities Skylines. This project marks a significant milestone in my coding journey, representing my first-ever large-scale endeavor.

While the code in this repository reflects my early programming efforts, it's crucial to note that substantial improvements have been made since then. Throughout this project, I was learning to code on the fly, leading to an evolving understanding of basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

Although the coding may appear amateurish in this context, I want to assure you that my skills have progressed considerably since that period. Subsequent projects showcase a more refined and sophisticated approach to coding and game development.

I invite you to explore this creation with the understanding that it captures a pivotal learning phase. I am eager to discuss the project further and provide insights into the advancements I have made in my coding proficiency.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my early work. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to share my growth and development in the realm of game development!

## Development Process

1. **Research and Case Studies:**
   - Conducted case studies of similar games to understand key features and elements contributing to user enjoyment.
   - Tailored my game by synthesizing the best aspects of these games.

2. **Community Input:**
   - Engaged with the community through a Reddit survey, gathering insights on desired changes and features in city-building games.

3. **Planning and Extensibility:**
   - Created a comprehensive plan for the code structure, emphasizing extensibility for future feature additions.

4. **Real-world Inspiration:**
   - Studied real-world cities for inspiration, ensuring a grounded and authentic approach to the game's design.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Documented the development process with screenshots from both Unity and the code itself.
   - Created pseudocode for each piece of code and established test acceptance criteria.
   - All documented in a comprehensive 374-page documentation.

6. **3D Modeling with Blender:**
   - Designed and created custom models for the game, including trees and buildings, using Blender as the 3D modeling software.

## Invitation to Explore

This repository not only serves as a showcase of the final product but also provides a detailed glimpse into the thought process, research, and dedication invested in creating this city-building game.

I invite you to explore both the game and the journey behind its development. Your insights and feedback are highly valued.

Thank you for taking the time to delve into this project.
